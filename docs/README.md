### Listing all tasks: `list`

Shows a list of all tasks in the task list.

### Finding tasks by keyword: `find`

Finds tasks whose descriptions contain a given search term.

Format: `find <search term>`

- `<search term>` may contain spaces for multi-word search queries.
- The search is case-sensitive, i.e. `book` will not match `Book`.
- The position of the search term in the description does not matter, e.g. `book` will match `read book`.
- Full words will be matched, e.g. `book` will match `books`.

Example:
- `find book` returns `read book` and `return book`

### Marking a task as done: `mark`

Marks a task as done.

Format: `mark <index>`

- `<index>` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
- `<index>` must be a positive integer starting from 1.
- An error message will be shown if `<index>` is invalid.

Example:

- `mark 1` marks the first task in the task list as done.

### Un-marking a marked task: `unmark`

Un-marks a task that is marked as done.

Format: `unmark <index>`

- `<index>` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
- `<index>` must be a positive integer starting from 1.
- An error message will be shown if `<index>` is invalid.

Example:

- `unmark 1` un-marks the first task in the task list.

### Deleting a task: `delete`

Deletes a task from the task list.

Format: `delete <index>`

- `<index>` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
- `<index>` must be a positive integer starting from 1.
- An error message will be shown if `<index>` is invalid.

Example:

- `delete 1` deletes the first task in the task list.

### Creating a command shortcut: `alias add`

Creates an alias for a command, which can be used instead to execute the command.

Only existing commands can be aliased; an alias cannot be created for another alias.
This prevents circular loops of aliases.

Format: `alias add <alias> <command>`

- `<alias>` must be a single word with no spaces and not already used as a command.
- `<command>` must be an valid pre-existing single-word command and not an alias.

Examples:

- `alias add l list` creates an alias `l` for the `list` command.
- `alias add l ls` is not allowed as `ls` is an alias.
- `alias add aa alias add` is not allowed as the command must be a single word.

### Deleting a command shortcut: `alias remove`

Removes an alias.

Format: `alias remove <alias>`

- `<alias>` must be an existing alias.

Example:

- `alias remove ls` removes the default alias `ls` for `list`.

### Listing all aliases: `alias list`

Shows a list of all aliases.

### Exiting the program: `bye`

Exits the program automatically after 3 seconds.
